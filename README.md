# A p2p web-based chat client using Hyper Hyper Space.

This simple chat client can be hosted as a static website, and works fully p2p.

It uses WebRTC leveraging [Hyper Hyper Space](https://github.com/hyperhyperspace/hyperhyperspace-core)'s shared data layer, [React](https://reactjs.org) and [Cavepaint CSS](https://cavepaint.github.io/cavepaintcss/).

This is WIP - non functional as of this commit.
